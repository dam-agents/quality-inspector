# Changelog

**Migration instructions, not a change log.** Per version, the idempotent **Upgrade**
steps a deployed instance applies when crossing it — what to run, update, or change
(schedules, config keys, state formats). Most versions need nothing. What changed and
why lives in the PR and commit history, not here. Consumed by the version check
([docs/persistence.md](docs/persistence.md) → **Definition version & upgrade**);
authoring rules: [docs/self-modification.md](docs/self-modification.md) §12.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-10-12

**Upgrade:**
1. Seed the new state, only where missing (`ONBOARDING.md` Step 2 holds the exact
   seeds): `work/HEALS.md`, `work/FLAKY.md`, `work/inventory/`, `work/regression/`.
2. Re-run `bash "$HOME/scripts/suite.sh" init` — it adds `work/suite/lib/criterion.ts`
   from the skeleton. Existing tests keep working; wrap their AC blocks in `criterion()`
   when they are next touched ([docs/test-authoring.md](docs/test-authoring.md)).
3. Offer once: `spec_feedback: enabled` — comment a suggested observable "Done when" on
   issues with nothing testable (public, opt-in; missing key = disabled).
4. `media_retention_days` defaults to 14 when missing; nothing to write.
5. Run `bash "$HOME/scripts/verify-onboarding.sh"` and apply every `fix:`.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-02

**Upgrade:**
Nothing — initial version; onboarding records it (`work/VERSION`).
